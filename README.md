# RoSave
An extension that USED TO IT NO LONGER WORKS saves you Robux on the catalog!

# Usage
Click the extension icon, and save a place id in the settings tab.

You can find the place id in the url of a game: ww<area>w.<area>roblox.<area>com/games/**12345**/game-name

Purchasing items on the catalog will give some of the cost to the game owner

I recommend the place is owned by a group you own, as part of the cost will *not* be given if the place is owned by you, and you can just give yourself the group funds.

Alternatively, you can use a game owned by another user/group to donate to them when you purchase items!

If you wish to donate to [the developer](https://www.roblox.com/users/103101520/profile), click save without specifying a place id ❤️
